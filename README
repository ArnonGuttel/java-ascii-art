1.  AsciiArtAlgorithm: This class implements the algorithm to generate ASCII art from an image. It takes 
    an input image, resolution, and a character matcher based on image brightness. It divides the input 
    image into smaller squares, calculates the brightness of each square, and maps each brightness value 
    to a corresponding ASCII character using the provided character matcher.

    Shell: This class represents a shell for interacting with the ASCII art generation program. It allows 
    users to modify parameters such as the character set, resolution, input image, output format, and run 
    the ASCII art generation algorithm. It uses the AsciiArtAlgorithm class to generate ASCII art based 
    on user inputs.

    ImageBrightnessCalculator: A utility class for calculating the brightness of an image. It provides a 
    method to calculate the brightness of an image based on the RGB values of its pixels.

    ImagePadder: A utility class for padding images to the nearest power of two dimensions. It provides a 
    method to pad an image with white pixels to make its dimensions a power of two.

    ImageSubDivider: A utility class to divide an image into smaller squares. It provides a method to 
    divide the original image into squares of a specified size.

    SubImgCharMatcher: This class provides functionality to match characters to image brightness levels. 
    It maps each character to a corresponding brightness value and provides methods to add, remove, and 
    retrieve characters from the character set based on their brightness. It is used by the 
    AsciiArtAlgorithm class to map brightness values to ASCII characters.

    The connections between these classes are as follows:
    The AsciiArtAlgorithm class uses the ImagePadder and ImageSubDivider utility classes to preprocess 
    the input image before generating ASCII art.
    The AsciiArtAlgorithm class uses the ImageBrightnessCalculator utility class to calculate the 
    brightness of image squares.
    The AsciiArtAlgorithm class uses the SubImgCharMatcher class to map brightness values to ASCII 
    characters.
    The Shell class interacts with the user to modify parameters and run the ASCII art generation 
    algorithm using the AsciiArtAlgorithm class.

2.  charsBrightnessMap: This variable is a TreeMap in the SubImgCharMatcher class. It maps characters to
    their corresponding brightness values. It's used to efficiently retrieve the brightness value of a 
    character and vice versa. The TreeMap is sorted based on the natural ordering of characters.

    brightnessMap: Also a TreeMap in the SubImgCharMatcher class. It maps brightness values to sets of 
    characters having the same brightness. This mapping allows for efficient retrieval of characters with 
    similar brightness levels. The TreeMap is sorted based on the natural ordering of brightness values.

    normalizedBrightnessMap: Another TreeMap in the SubImgCharMatcher class. It stores a normalized 
    version of the brightness map, where brightness values are scaled between 0 and 1. This normalization 
    facilitates efficient lookup of characters based on normalized brightness values.

3.  IllegalArgumentException: This exception is thrown in several places in the code, primarily in the  
    Shell class. It is used to handle invalid user inputs or states that violate preconditions. For     
    example:
    When the user tries to modify the ASCII matcher with an invalid command or parameters.
    When the user tries to change the resolution to a value that exceeds the boundaries defined by the 
    input image size.
    When the user provides invalid parameters for modifying the ASCII matcher, such as an empty string or 
    an invalid range.
    In each case, the exception message provides information about the specific problem encountered, 
    helping the user understand what went wrong and how to correct it.

    IOException: This exception is thrown in the Image class constructor when there is an error reading 
    the input image file. It is used to handle scenarios where the input image file is not found or 
    cannot be read due to file system errors. In the changeImage() method of the Shell class, this 
    exception is caught, and a message is printed to inform the user that the image could not be loaded.
